# EXPERIMENT-3

AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT:- To study and implement the concept of tuple in Python and perform operations such as accessing elements, counting occurrences, and checking conditions, and to understand the difference between tuple and list.

THEORY:- difference between tuple and list

Tuple is written using round brackets ( ) while list is written using square brackets [ ]

Tuple is immutable, so its elements cannot be changed after creation

List is mutable, so its elements can be modified, added, or removed

Tuple is generally faster in execution compared to list

Tuple uses less memory than list

Tuple is mainly used to store fixed or constant data.

Algorithm 

Algorithm: Display Student Result Using Tuple

Start

Create a tuple named student_result containing subject name, marks, and grade

Assign the first element of the tuple to variable subject

Assign the second element of the tuple to variable marks

Assign the third element of the tuple to variable grade

Display the subject

Display the marks obtained

Display the grade

Check if marks is greater than or equal to 75

If true, display "Distinction"

End

Algorithm: Attendance Record Analysis Using Tuple

Start

Create a tuple named attendance_record containing attendance values ('P' for Present and 'A' for Absent)

Count the number of 'P' in the tuple and store it in present_days

Display the total number of present days

Count the number of 'A' in the tuple and store it in absent_days

Display the total number of absent days

Check whether 'A' is present in the tuple

If present, display "The employee was absent at least once during the recorded period."

Otherwise, display "The employee was present every day during the recorded period."

End

Conclusion

In this experiment, we learned how to use tuples in Python to store fixed data and perform operations like counting values and accessing elements. We also understood the major differences between tuple and list, especially in terms of mutability and usage. Tuples are preferred when data should remain unchanged, while lists are useful when frequent modifications are required.
